"""Short lived conversations state (who is typing what right now).

Every flow is *short lived* on purpose. The owner once hit a nasty bug: an old
step stayed armed for days, so every random text he typed was swallowed as the
answer (“যেকোনো টেক্সট দিলে বারে বারে সেভ হইতেছে”) — a store name, a channel or a
limit got overwritten over and over. Flows now

* expire after `FLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 10 minutes),
* give up after 3 invalid answers,
* are dropped as soon as the admin taps any button (they clearly moved on).
